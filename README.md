### House Price Analysis

Welcome to the House Price Analysis project! This repository contains code and resources for analyzing and predicting house prices using various data science and machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to provide insights into factors affecting house prices and build predictive models to forecast future prices.

#### Project Overview

House prices are influenced by numerous factors such as location, size, amenities, and market conditions. This project aims to explore these factors through data analysis and build models to predict house prices, aiding buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions.

#### Features

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Cleans and preprocesses house price data to ensure it is suitable for analysis.
  - Handles missing values and encodes categorical data to make it usable for machine learning models.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualizes data to identify patterns and relationships between different features and house prices.
  - Uses plots such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to gain insights from the data.

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Extracts relevant features and creates new ones to improve the performance of prediction models.
  - Includes transformations and interactions of existing features to capture more complex relationships.

- **Model Training**:
  - Implements and trains various machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
  - Uses historical house price data to learn patterns and trends that can be used for prediction.

- **Price Prediction**:
  - Provides house price predictions based on the trained models.
  - Outputs predicted prices for given property features, helping users estimate the value of houses.

- **Evaluation and Metrics**:
  - Includes evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to assess model performance.
  - Compares results across different models to select the best-performing one for house price prediction.
